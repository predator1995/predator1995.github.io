### How to avoid boredom?

Hi, my name is Mukhammad, from times to times i come across the feeling called Boredom. Boredom means spending my spare time by doing nothing: surfing the Inet, watching videos on social networking websites (in terms of entertainment) and so on.

Last year, i realised that this took me more than 30% of my time. Then, i calculated how much i sleep, work and relax, and understood that i had to change something in my life. That was merely challenge for me, because i dislike to be stable.

> I'd work hard, otherwise my life costs nothing.

The phrase mentioned above, could drive me a bit, no, that is not motivation. From very beginning, i did not do much work, i just went to pull up with my neighbour. Two weeks we were training together, through the sweat and some effort (some truth is there).

Weeks and months were flowing in front us, after the long vacation (summer), we got some results 💪🏼, not as big as depicted sticker, but anyways... . That was not satisfactory for me, because that was only physical training.

 Then, i realised that i had to prepare myself mentally as well, and prepared some activities  👋 

1. Creating projects in the field of robotics
2. Recording videos (already stopped):)
3. Recording podcasts 

> **Robotics**

Robotics was the field of my study and work at university. It was appealing to start with doing some minor projects, but with the lapse of time, i got bored, due to the fact that no any necessary equipment was provided for further bigger and profitable projects i could do. However, i stopped it, because left the uni and moved to Tashkent.

> **Recording videos**

_That all happened before i moved to the capital_.

The story proceeds with recording videos and uploading them on Youtube channel. I wanted to record some humorous videos, the theme was AaA (Ask and Answer). The main problem was to work on video editing, because i did not have cool skills in that sphere. It lasted approximately 2-3 months, and in the long run, stopped (lack of endeavour, maybe).

> **Podcasting**

The story ends in the stage of recording podcasts. I'm still passionate about this type of activity:

- First of all, i recorded it with my sister. She helped me to discuss some topics we like together. We made different kinds of schemes of how to deliver a message to people of their interested question.

- Secondly, as i'm talkative person and the person who loves publicity, i wanted to be public through the Inet and my topics i love to talk about. Therefore, i started recording podcasts, and yes, they are still available on Yandex Music platform.

Currently, i'm looking for the person that can be a good partner in recording podcasts with me:)

Mentioned activities, could help me to stay sober and fresh (not bored) in the all meanings of this phrase. :)

All i wanted to say: 

> Do not be afraid of doing new activities, they are just experience!
